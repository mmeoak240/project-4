# Fitness Routine Builder -- work in progress

This is a full stack web application built using React for the frontend and Rails for the backend. The objective of this project is to showcase my abilities in creating a full stack app.

## Getting started

Download repository
run `bash'bundle install'` and `bash'npm install --prefix client'`
next run `bash'rails s'` to get your server up and running
lastly run `bash'run npm start --prefix client'` to open up the application in your browser

Features
A user may sign up for an account and sign in using those credentials(there is also an admin log in that grants access to additional functionality). Once logged in the user can visit the "Exercises" page to view the list of exercises that have been created by the applications creator. While on the "Exercises" page the user may click "More info" to view a description of the selected exercise. While viewing the more info page the user will have the opportunity to write a review about the exercise and post it with their username being attached. The user will also be able to edit and delete their reviews. As the admin you have the added option to create exercises.

Pending Features
The ability for the user to build routines by adding exercises to a personal routine page.
The ability for the admin to create pre-made routines and post them.
Ability for users to add pre-made routines to their personal routine page.
Exercise/Routine search and filter functionality

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
